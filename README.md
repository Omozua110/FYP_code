# FYP_code
To run the code relevant to this thesis, the github in the link https://github.com/Omozua110/FYP must be cloned.

Due to the large size of the files, it was not possible to load them onto a github so to run this code you will have to download the "database.db" and the "state_CA.csv" files and put them in the clone repository as so:
   - The file "database.db" should be added into the webapp directory, path would be webapp/database.db

   - The state_CA.csv file should be put in the Experiments1_2 directory with path Experiments1_2/state_CA.csv

After these steps are completed the code will be good to run

All files in Experiment 1 and 2 have ben run already for ease due to the computational expense and complexity of it as well as the similarity between files
The web app can be run as usual using the flask run command.
